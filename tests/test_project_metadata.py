    The lazy-install system exists so one quarantined PyPI release (e.g.
    mistralai 2.4.6) can't break every fresh install. Putting a backend in BOTH
    [all] and the lazy map defeats that — fresh installs eager-install it and
    inherit whatever's broken upstream.

    If you're tempted to add an opt-in backend to [all] for "convenience," map
    it in ``LAZY_FEATURES`` instead so it installs at first use.

    The set of lazy extras is DERIVED from ``LAZY_FEATURES`` rather than
    mirrored by hand: the old hardcoded list had to be updated separately from
    the code it described, so a new backend could be added to both the lazy map
    and [all] with this test still passing (``[acp]`` and ``[google]`` had both
    silently drifted into exactly that state).
